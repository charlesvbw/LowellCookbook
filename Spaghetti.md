### Spaghetti

# Ingredients
3/4 cup chopped onion
2 teaspoons canola oil
6 garlic cloves, divided
1 pound plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise
1 1/3 cups lower-sodium marinara sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1/3 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
12 ounces ground sirloin (90% lean)
1 large egg
Cooking spray
6 ounces uncooked spaghetti
1.5 ounces fresh Parmesan cheese, grated (about 6 tablespoons)

# Directions
1. Preheat broiler to high.
2. Combine onion, oil, 3 garlic cloves, and tomatoes in a bowl; toss to coat vegetables. Arrange tomato mixture on a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil 10 minutes or until vegetables char slightly, stirring after 5 minutes. Spoon tomato mixture into the bowl of a food processor; pulse 6 times or until mixture is coarsely chopped. Combine tomato mixture, marinara, and 3/8 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan; bring to a simmer.
3. Mince remaining 3 garlic cloves. Combine minced garlic, remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt, panko, red pepper, beef, and egg in a large bowl; mix gently just until combined. Working quickly with damp hands, gently shape beef mixture into 12 meatballs (do not pack). Arrange meatballs in a single layer on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Broil 6 inches from heat for 6 minutes, turning meatballs once. Remove pan from oven. Add meatballs to tomato mixture; simmer 4 minutes or until meatballs are done.
4. Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt and fat. Serve meatballs and sauce over pasta; sprinkle with cheese.
